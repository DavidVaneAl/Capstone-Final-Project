# Capstone Final Project

## Objectives 

The **goal** of the Capstone project is to create an application to predict the next word in a sentence. For this project have the following objectives to develop an optimal application

1. Analyze large textual dataset 
2. Build an algorithm to predict words
3. Create a predictive web application
4. Create a presentation in order to explain the steps taken to develop the project

## Modeling

Tasks to accomplish

1. Build basic n-gram model - using the exploratory analysis performed, build a basic [N - GRAM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/N-gram) model for predicting the next word based on the previous 1, 2, or 3 words.
2. Build a model to handle unseen n-grams - in some cases people will want to type a combination of words that does not appear in the corpora. Build a model to handle cases where a particular n-gram isn't observed.

## Prediction model

The goal of this exercise is to build and evaluate the first predictive model. Use the n-gram and backoff models built in previous tasks to build and evaluate the predictive model. The goal is to make the model efficient and accurate.

Tasks to accomplish

1. Build a predictive model based on the previous data modeling steps - may combine the models in any way think is appropriate.
2. Evaluate the model for efficiency and accuracy - use timing software to evaluate the computational complexity of the model. Evaluate the model accuracy using different metrics like perplexity, accuracy at the first word, second word, and third word.

## Creative exploration

So far have used basic models to understand and predict words. In this next task, the goal is to use all the resources have available  (from the Data Science Specialization, resources on the web, or own creativity) to improve the predictive accuracy while reducing computational runtime and model complexity (if can). Be sure to hold out a test set to evaluate the new, more creative models are building.

Tasks to accomplish

1. Explore new models and data to improve the predictive model.
2. Evaluate the new predictions on both accuracy and efficiency.

## Data product

The goal of this exercise is to create a product to highlight the prediction algorithm that have built and to provide an interface that can be accessed by others via a Shiny app.

Tasks to accomplish

1. Create a data product to show off the prediction algorithm should create a Shiny app that accepts an n-gram and predicts the next word.

## Slide Deck

The goal of this exercise is to "pitch" the data product to boss or an investor. The slide deck is constrained to be 5 slides or less and should: (1) explain how model works, (2) describe its predictive performance quantitatively and (3) show off the app and how it works.

Tasks to accomplish

Create a slide deck promoting the product. Write 5 slides using RStudio Presenter explaining the product and why it is awesome!
