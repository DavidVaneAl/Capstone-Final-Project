## Introduction 

The **goal** of the Capstone project is to create an application to predict the next word in a sentence. For this project we have the following objectives to develop an optimal application

1. Analyze large textual dataset 
2. Build an algorithm to predict words
3. Create a predictive web application [Shiny Apps](https://www.shinyapps.io)
4. Create a presentation in order to explain the steps taken to develop the project

## Algorithm

- Download provided dataset: blogs, news and twitter source from [HERE](http://www.corpora.heliohost.org/)
Data processing: sampling, cleaning, local storage for text with and without English Stop Words
- Built N-grams: 2 and 3 grams were created for the prediction

## Predictor Shiny App 

- Prediction: use input words as a reference to search for the n-gram table. The most frequent next words will be shown as the return value.
